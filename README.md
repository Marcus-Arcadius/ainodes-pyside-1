Welcome to our first alpha release, please expect many improvements in a very short amount of time.

To setup run setup.bat, it will create a conda environment called "ai-pixel" and install depencencies.

to run, run run.bat, it will activate the conda environment, and call python frontend/main_app.py.

You can do both manually.

Linux, macOS installers coming up.
